# Twitter Scraping with scraping tool Snscrape API

The project is to Scrape the data from the social networking site Twitter using **Snscrape API**

We can fetch data like tweets id,username,url,date etc and here in this project to do that we use *Snscrape API*

The Sncrape API does not come with any scraping limits and there is no need of creating an account to scrape like some twitters APIs do ask for account creation
